# hostelmanagement
Our project is on hostel room allotment system where the preferences will be given by students.
We are building an algorithm which is fueled entirely by matching theory. 
We will collect the data like the total types of rooms available and the students available and then will create a database. The project is Designed to keep the record of the students living in hostels, allocation of rooms, monthly dues yearly dues etc.
Our basic aim is to computerize the current procedure of allocating hostel rooms which is usually followed in almost all the hostels.

We have made the algorithm from scratch by ourselves, then we have planned to create one interface. And after all this when our project will be complete we will pass it on to our hostel warden sir so that they can use this algorithm in real time for allocation in our vit hostels.
Actually our project is not yet completed, we are currently working on it. We will create a website or an application where everything will work on by the algorithm which we have build.
